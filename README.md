# WebServiceKit - An Objective-C framework for interacting with various web services
WebServiceKit provides an Objective-C API for interacting with various Web Services
in an asynchronous way. The goal of WebServiceKit is to support both SOAP (1.1 and 1.2)
as well as REST services and provide automatic deserialization and serialization of
remote objects to native Objective-C objects.

## Todo
- Examples
- SOAP 1.1 support (currently only working on 1.2 support)
- Script or application for automatically generating the appropriate WSKService subclass
and associated objects with available methods exposed.
- REST support
- Pluggable object serialization/deserialization API for when the built-in ones won't do
- iOS support (requires NSXMLNode/NSXMLElement/NSXMLDocument/etc. replacement)
- Unit Tests
